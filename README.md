# Refactor
A code refactoring project.
This is a code refactoring project that I've been working on
You can view the source code
THEN all find semantic HTML elements
You can view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN you find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
You can view the icon and image elements
THEN find accessible alt attributes
You can view the heading attributes
THEN they all fall in sequential order
You can view the title element
THEN find a concise, descriptive title
